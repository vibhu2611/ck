                                We are aware that NFT provides exclusive ownership rights. It is almost like copyright

                                the buzz that our cinema artists, actors, directors, and producers create, owning their
                                works, autographs, and pictures in NFTs is absolute gold.</p>

                                C-Swap will be a decentralized exchange (DEX), that is a peer-to-peer (P2P) trading
                                platform where crypto assets will be transacted directly between buyers and sellers.
                                C-Swap will rely on self-executing smart contracts that keep track of every transaction
                                and log it to the blockchain. The vision behind C-swap is to have permission-less access
                                to trading, end-to-end on-chain infrastructure with no central points of failure and
                                decentralized ownership across a community of distributed stakeholders. C-Swap will
                                offer strong execution guarantee and increased transparency into the underlying
                                mechanics of trading.</p>
